# motion_predict

This library implements some basic motion prediction functions meant to support external object handling under the motion_predict namespace. Currently there are two motion models implements a Constant Velocity (CV) model and a Constant Turn-Rate and Velocity (CTRV) model. See the motion_predict.hpp and predict_ctrv.hpp files for the relevant interfaces.
